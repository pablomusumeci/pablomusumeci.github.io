I know almost nothing about Javascript and I'm not saying this just to sound humble. This is kinda embarrasing because JS is nowadays one of the most used programing languages over the internet.
A [friend of mine](http://nachogaray.net) always says "No one really knows Javascript but everyone codes on it".

However, I've recently found a great video about how Javascript code is executed by the browser, including the interaction between [V8](https://code.google.com/p/v8/) and the famous "Event Loop". The following marvelous 25-minute presentation gives you a good idea about what is happening inside your browser right now.
