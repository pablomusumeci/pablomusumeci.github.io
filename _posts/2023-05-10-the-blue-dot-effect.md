Original study is actually **Prevalence-induced concept change in human judgment** by Levari.

## Idea
The Blue Dot Effect shows that when the signal we're searching for becomes rare, we tend to broaden our definition of it, causing us to perceive it even when it's not there. 

In other words, **the more we look for threats, the more we see them**, regardless of how safe our environment is. 

This phenomenon can make some social problems seem intractable, as reducing their prevalence leads people to see more of them. 

## Real Life Example
Consider the endless stream of issues vying for our attention on social media. If we're constantly searching for problems or threats, we'll start to see them even in harmless situations. This can lead us to waste our time and energy on trivial matters, rather than focusing on what's truly important.

## Quote
> Because you can’t get rid of pain—pain is the universal constant of the human condition. 
> Therefore, the attempt to move away from pain, to protect oneself from all harm, can only backfire. 
> 
> Trying to eliminate pain only increases your sensitivity to suffering, rather than alleviating your suffering. 
> It causes you to see dangerous ghosts in every nook, to see tyranny and oppression in every authority, to see hate and deceit behind every embrace.

## Solution
Be mindful of the problems you choose to focus on. You only have limited f*cks to give away in your life.

Ask yourself, **Am I choosing my problems, or are my problems choosing me?**.
By consciously selecting the issues that truly matter, we can avoid falling into the trap of the `Blue Dot Effect` and maintain a more balanced perspective on life.
