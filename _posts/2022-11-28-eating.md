# About health and fitness

Let me show you who am I so you understand where this is coming from: This a picture of me when I was 10 years old. 

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
![fat](/assets/images/eating/pablon_gordo.jpeg)
{: refdef}

This is also me but last year enjoying holidays in Positano, Italy.

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
![fit](/assets/images/eating/pablon_flaco.jpeg)
{: refdef}


Look at how happy I was, I truly had the time of my life. It felt like a long awaited dream came to reality. Positano? No, I'm just talking about my abs.


Over the last 20 years my body changed a lot. For most people getting older usually means getting in worse shape.
For me it was quite the opposite, I kept getting leaner and stronger year after year.

More interesting that what you can see in this picture is what you can't. I want to talk about how my mindset changed so my body could do the same.

# My journey

Why does being in good shape matters?
It's not about living a longer life. It's about living a happier life. You can too have a happier life, it's much
simpler than what you think but it's also harder than what you image. Mainly at the beginning, that is worst part for sure.


I'm now in a stage of my life where I don't endlessly torture myself about food or exercise. It took me sweat, blood and tears 
but I wouldn't change a single thing.

It's curious how what you need the most might be the hardest thing to get. If you are out of shape then exercising becomes a much harder endeavor than
if you happened to be in good shape. Paradoxically, that is the moment when you need it the most.


I always wanted to have an aesthetic body. I fantasized that I would be 
(or feel if there is there any difference) prettier and more successful if I had such type of body. 
Be more popular, confident, and of course be happy. Not just happier but happy.


I spent a ridiculous amount of time looking at the mirror every time I got out of the shower. 
Never satisfied with whatever level of fitness I had at that moment.
It's very comfortable to simply blame genetics and that's what I did for a long time. 
That relieves me of any responsibility as there is nothing you can do about that.


I'm not going to lie in saying that my fitness journey had a higher purpose such as being healthy and more energized. 
I wanted to look good. Might seem like a superficial end but I always struggled with self-confidence issues (who hasn't?) 
and never felt so good about myself as the times when I was in the best shape.

I mostly believe that people who deem an aesthetic body a goal not worth pursuing is because they never experienced
the intoxicating self-confidence boost provided by walking shirtless around the beach. On top of that, you also
get all the other non-frivolous benefits everybody feels good mentioning so it's a win-win situation.

I would love to say that one day something clicked and I stumbled upon the definite success formula for being fit but life is sadly not that easy. 
To be where I now take years of experimenting with numerous diets and workouts. I still think that the journey is not over and I will keep
tweaking my habits as long as I'm alive.

If I had to summarize what I learned is: Find something that works **for you**. And because each one of us is unique there is no one size fits all solution.
Go out there and find your own. 

Even if a magical solution existed and I served it to you on a silver plate, you wouldn't fully believe nor understand it until you experienced it by yourself.


> Experience is the hardest kind of teacher. It gives you the test first and the lesson afterward.
>
> -- <cite>Oscar Wilde</cite>

Anyway, I still think that even my findings can help at least one single person to advance their life into a more enjoyable state
then I would have already achieved something to be proud of.

Let's start!

# On eating healthy

## It's impossible to out-train a bad diet

I feel obliged to mention this as it's the bedrock of my entire philosophy regarding health, fitness and exercising.

Don't even try it. The way to loose fat is through exercising a "mouth plank". That is trying to keep your mouth closed as much as you can.

Jokes aside, have you ever seen the ridicolous amount of exercise needed to burn just a handful of calories?

It's a million times easier to skip an ice-cream (I'm saying this with ice-cream being my favourite dessert of all time) than to run for half an hour. 
Don't blindly optimize your calorical intake and expenditure blindly. Pick the battles that are worth fighting for.


**It takes five minutes to consume the same 500 calories that takes an hour to burn off.**

I know this because there was a point in my life where I was doing Crossfit 7 times a week. Yes, every single day. 
I was bigger and stronger but not lean enough to show visible abs. Why? So much exercise made **so hungry**. 

Not only that, because I exercised very intensibely I always felt entitled to not control my portions and being lenient the food I ate.


## Our toughest enemy lives inside our head

I always ask myself, why do we do the things that we do? There is a voice inside my head responsible for almost everything I do. 

That voice is not very loud. I never actually heard it clearly. 
That would make things so much easier as I could at least argue against it and subdue it through reason. I could fight back.
 

This voice is really clever though, that's why it decides to stay within the shadows. It is so much easier for it to just whisper to your ear. 


It directly talks to your subconcious mind. I refer to it as the autopilot.

Daniel Kahneman refers this autopilot mode as the **System one** inside our brain. It is fast, automatic and impulsive. 
An almost instantaneous process which happens with very little effort and minimal energy expenditure.

It has many names other names being  **The Lizard Brain** one of its most famous.

> The Lizard Brain is hungry, scared, selfish and horny.
>
> -- <cite>Seth Godin</cite>


### The Lizard Brain

This is your toughest enemy. You can tame it but it will never go away. 
It might seclude itself inside the darkest corner of your brain waiting for the perfect time to strike back.


The Lizard Brain seems to be the cause of all our problems as humans. How can we turn it off? First of all don't. 
We need it. It is precisily thanks to this particular section of our brain, the amygdala, that we are alive today. 
It guided all the generations that preceeded us, kept them alive and inducted them to procreate so we can be alive today. 

It's not stupid or evil, it's just outdated.

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
![lizard](/assets/images/eating/lizard.jpg)
{: refdef}

The Lizard Brain developed in an era where food was scarce, unnacassible and boring. 

It spent most of its time in an environment where eating was an event that happened every few days instead of every couple of hours. 

Where getting food involved risking your life by either hunting or eating unsafe/unpasteurized aliments. 
Moreover, food was just... dull. 

{% include video id="qtZfTpV4KPE" provider="youtube" %}


#### Know your enemy

Have you ever heard about [Nutri-Score](https://www.dw.com/en/opinion-why-europe-should-abandon-the-nutri-score/a-62922313)?

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
![fit](/assets/images/eating/nutriscore.png)
{: refdef}

It was conceived as a simple indicator for consumers on how healthy a given product is. 

[There is quite a lot of controversy around its effectiveness though.](https://www.dw.com/en/opinion-why-europe-should-abandon-the-nutri-score/a-62922313)


Turns out that, if you turn it upside down it becomes an indicator for how tasty something is.

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
![fit](/assets/images/eating/kitkat.png)
{: refdef}


E becomes an indicator of something being exquisite. It also stands for extremly packed with calories and that's why its exceptionally appealing to the lizard brain. 

If you grew up not knowing when was the next meal going to happen then
every time you have a chance you are going to go all-in.


We are **by design** programmed to love calorically dense foods. 
If you were a caveman who stumbled over a pack of Oreos from time to time, you would had had the upper hand in terms of survival. 
The problem is that now we face this miracoulous concentrated calory bomb every time we walk 5 steps into our kitchen cabinets.
The lizard brain doesn't know when to stop. It's behaves exactly like a child with no self-control whatsoever.


#### Outsmarting the lizard brain

The lizard brain is the king of impulses. The enemy of impulses is having a plan. 

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
![lizard](/assets/images/eating/laughing_lizard.gif)
{: refdef}

For every time you think *I should pass on dessert* the Lizard Brain will come up with an extensive repertoir 
of very good reasons why you should have that cheesecake. 

> Come on, you worked out so hard this week. What's the reason of being alive if you can't enjoy a tiny piece of cake?
>
> -- <cite>The lizard brain</cite>- 

If you plan ahead, your impulses have a smaller chance getting you out of track. An example could be to always have
fruits available at home. The moment you don't have a healthy option available your brain has one less barrier of defense
against making a choice that goes against your goals.

We have the power to dominate our impulses but coming up with an effective system
for doing that is a crucial piece of the puzzle. 

> You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.
>
> -- <cite>James Clear</cite>- 


Set yourself for success. Eating well starts way before you put food inside your mouth. It starts even before you are feeling hungry.

It starts when you do your groceries. The food you buy and especially the ones you don't.  
If don't buy crap then sabotaging your plan becomes much harder.

Don't fall for sales, the lizard brain is going to use your love for promotions as an argument for buying a jar of Nutella 
just because it's cheaper now. 

Or maybe it will convince you that you should have something tasty to snack on in case you have visits. 
What kind of host offers just apples or bananas to its guests?

Don't fall into the trap. Stay strong. 

> Between stimulus and response there is a space. In that space is our power to choose our response. In our response lies our growth and our freedom.
>
> -- <cite>Victor Frankl</cite>

## Long term consistency beats short term intensity

In dieting as in life there are ups and downs. It's impossible to keep a perfect diet all the time. 

Seeing life as black and white is a simplification we humans tend to lean on a lot. 
That's the reason why when starting on a diet we mostly see one clear way moving forward:

Starting an epic herculean diet where you only eat clean foods. David Goggins level of intensity. You take an oath of commiting to the strictiest diet which will
undoubtaely fail after a few weeks. 100% guaranteed it will fail. We are only humans at that is the reality we need to embrace.

What usually happens is that at some point we have a monologue in our heads where the lizard brain brings up *What's the point of
being alive if we can't enjoy nice things?*. Very compelling argument if you ask me. Then you give yourself a break and eat one pizza slice.

Then you say *I already had one so I might as well get two*. From there onwards everything goes downhill and you are back at square one.

**A 7 out of 10 diet you can sustain is much better than a 10 out of 10 diet that's doomed to failure.**

I’m never on a diet because I’m always on a diet. Whatever you decide to do always go for something that you can sustain over time.
Look at your eating habits and ask yourself, can I keep eating like this forever? If the answer is no adjust your habits until you 
reach something that aligns to your goals and can be sustained over time.

Remember that it's a two way street. If you **never** allow yourself a treat and live in absolute misery because of that,
 one day or another you are going to snap as the life you are living is not one that makes you happy. Same if you never restrain yourself.

## Every decision counts

> Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become.
>
> -- <cite>James Clear</cite>- 

Every time I have options, I attempt to choose the hardest. 

- Elevator or stairs
- Salad or fries
- Walking or taking the bus
- Soda or water


All these small actions are they might be almost neglectible when analyzed individually. 
No one gets fit by just using the stairs. Although, it is a tiny contribution to embody 
the ideal you are pursuing. It's a matter of just get enough of those small contributions.


> If you are willing to do only what’s easy, life will be hard. But if you are willing to do what’s hard, life will be easy.
>
> -- <cite>T. Harv Eker</cite>- 

It's not easy and I for sure not always manage to do the hard thing. Somedays we feel weak, we slip and dissapoint ourselves.
It's fine as long as we pick ourselves again as soon as possible. If we start accumulating bad decisiones
then it soon will become the default response.



## Expectations
 
Hunger is not logical nor linear. By linear I mean that you would expect that if you are hungry and you 
take action to extinguish that need then it will only keep increasing.

Reality is that if you can resist the temptation that roaring tummy will calm by itself and that hunger
that seemed an unostoppable force will silently dissapear.

We tend to be hungry around the times were we usually eat. That's why starting with intermittent fasting feels impossible
because your body will strongly demand you feed it at the same time you usually do.

After a few days it will adapt to the new schedule and forget that it used receive food during the morning.

> Human beings can get used to virtually anything, given plenty of time and no choice in the matter whatsoever.
>
> -- <cite>Tom Holt</cite>


## Beware of false idols

There are things that look like a good fit for a healthy diet but are actually a poisoned chalice.

Granola, nuts and especially orange juice. What do they have in common? They are natural, they taste amazing and are so easy to overconsume.

> If it is too good to be true, it is probably a fraud.
>
> -- <cite>Ron Weber</cite>

Always be wary. Things advertised as low-fat compensate by extra sugar and the other way around. Magic does not exist. If it tastes
**really** good then there is contains something that is pushing our buttons.


{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
![lizard](/assets/images/eating/scooby.png)
{: refdef}


There is still hope though. Of course we need to avoid some of the foods that make our brain light up like a christmass tree
but that is not the same as abandoning every single food that gives us pleasure in life.

### Invest in fruits and vegetables

Given that you are going to rely heavyly on this type of food, I would recommend spending an extra buck on getting the tastiest greenies you can afford. 
It does make a huge difference in terms of flavour. Invest on your well-being as there are little things with a bigger effect on your life than your own well-being.


If it tastes good it's easier to stay on the healthy path.
Eating a [Jazz apple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jazz_(apple)) feels better than a eating KitKat. Healthier but more expensive though.

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
![jazz](/assets/images/eating/jazz.png)
{: refdef}


### Learn how to cook the basics

The difference in flavour by doing something as simple as brinning a chicken breast 30 minutes before cooking is astonishing. 
A similar thing happens when steaming broccoli, if you do leave for 2 minutes longer than it should the flavour and texture changes dramatically. 

You don't need to become a Michelin chef be any means. Learn the fundamentals on creating appealing flavours.

## Develop a system

I got tired of fighting against TLB so I decided to develop a system for solving my internal disputes once and for all. This established a precedent in a way
that I never even get the chance to wonder the answer to questions like *Should I skip the gym today?*

> By failing to prepare, you are preparing to fail.
>
> -- <cite>Benjamin Franklin</cite>

The question doesn't even arise in my mind. I know that if I don't have anything else to do I go to the gym. I never miss a workout *just because*. I might miss
workouts if I feel tired and I rather have some rest. If I have scheduled a gathering with my friends and I cannot make it to the gym. But there must be a good reason for skipping a chance
to exercise.

## Intermitent Fasting

Big topic in the fitness comunity. It's most commonly known as *skipping breakfast* but it could be any prolonged period of time without food during the day. 

I do it mostly for two reasons:

- I realized that I have the same level of hunger at lunch regardless of eating breakfast or not, so I might as well skip it.
- I don't encounter myself feeling sluggish during the mornings if I skip breakfast.

## Becoming a dog

I decided to be like my dog, who eats the same meal over and over every single day. Of course, my dog doesn't have much choice on this but I do it volunteraly.

I don't know many people who takes this same approach towards food and that made me feel a bit uncomfortable when I started with this routine.

> If you want something you’ve never had, you must be willing to do something you’ve never done.
>
> -- <cite>Thomas Jefferson</cite>

Turns up that it makes your life so much simpler. My default lunch during winter time is grilled chicken breast with steamed broccoli. Maybe I add
some boiled sweet potatos depending on how hard am I hitting the gym.

During summer I just go for salads which by the way do not have to be boring at all. If your salads are tasteless it might be that you are:

- Not using quality ingredients.
- Not being creative enough with the combination of different flavours and textures.
- Not preparing a good dressing.

I try to stick with foods that are its own ingredient. For example: The ingredients of broccoli are just... broccoli. Boring but effective.
Avoid processed foods is also something I do. I stay away from carbs specially as I never find them saciating enough. It's incredible easy
for me to eat a whole pizza and not feeling satisfied. Trying to do that with chicken breast and broccoli and you will understand what I mean.


Besides those guidelines I don't follow any famous diet. No Keto, Paleo, Atkins, whatever. 
I use common sense for determining what is healthy and what is not.

I don't think people eat bad because they don't know what is good for them. We are weaker and lazier than what we are ignorants.


## Be honest with yourself

Are you willing to pay the price of whatever is the body you are looking for? If you want to have a top 5% body then you need to be
willing to make the sacrifices 95% of the people are not willing to make. Imagine being in a room with other 19 people who are enjoying
a piece of cake while you are the only one who is not. Going to the gym while everybody else is either partying or sleeping.

I'm not saying that level of sacrifice is for everybody. Be mindful between the aligment of what you are willing to put and
what are you level of going to get.


## What is your hit percentage?

You don't need to strive for perfection by going into an draconian diet. Those diets, the more extreme, are the ones that always fail.

Think about it this way, you have 2 meals a day, 7 days a week. Those are 14 chances of eating healthy or not. 
I'm simplyfing this a lot by not talking about calories or macros. Just a green ticket when 
you consider you had a healthy meal and a red cross when you haven't. 

What ratio are you currently at? If you have 4 out of 14 meals as healthy ones,
try to move that number higher. Put a target. Some weeks you are going to be beat the target, others you are going to fall short.
The important is to be mindful about it and that's when tracking makes a lot of difference. 

Journaling this kind of stuff (in an app, a phisical notebook, a excel spreadsheet, whatever works for you) is what keep you consistent
with your habits. Even if you do it only for yourself and even if you never look back at the data you logged. Don't ask me 
why but knowing that you have to keep a record of it forces ourselves to put our best.

You can lie to anyone else in the world, but you can't lie to yourself. 
 
### What are you optimizing for?

Why do I eat always the same meals? Because I optimize for nutrition instead of flavour.
I care only about getting the best fuel for my body. And I repeat that every single day. 

This is why take away and restaurants are rarely friends of healthy eating. Their business is to sell food. The tastiest food is the one
people like the most and would likely come back to get more, regardless of how good is that for your body. They optimize for taste, not for nutrition.

If you learn how to cook it and you like it then you are not going to get bored very easily.


## Tracking

There was a period in my life where I experimented with counting calories, a very famous but time consuming technique. I did it for a month and I strongly recommend
everybody to do that for a similar period of time.

One month of tracking is enough for you to build a pretty good idea on how nutritious are all the things that you usually consume. More than a month might be just
a waste of your time as tracking is hard. Even when using something like [MyFitnessPal](https://www.myfitnesspal.com/) like I did.

I encourage you to track **everything**. From an apple to that apparently innocent spoon of mayo. You will build a decent level of awareness 
and uncover those false gods [link to false gods] that are not as healthy as they pretend to be. 

Most of your initial estimations around food calories will be just plain wrong. Here you will confirm that it's impossible to outrain a bad diet.



# On exercising

### Attending is Step 0

Lots of people think that going to the gym is enough. I'm using going to the gym as a synonym for exercising because that's what I do but feel
free to imagine any phisical activity of your preference.

What do I mean by this? Transporting your body from the comfort of your home into the gym is an important step. But it means nothing
if you are only going to be there to take selfies and waste your time by playing around with your phone.

If you go there, you need to **be** there to make it work. If you are not breaking a sweat and pushing yourself.

> You’ve got to exercise. Your health account, your bank account, they’re the same thing. The more you put in, the more you can take out.
>
> -- <cite>Jack LaLanne</cite>


### Keep technology out of it

Leave your phone in the locker room. No excuses. You want to be present in the moment and your phone will do everything in its power
to distract you. Emails, messages, notifications, you name it.

What do you need?

- A digital wrist watch to measure the resting time between series. The dumber the watch the better.
- Notebook for tracking your workout. Pen and paper should do the trick.
- A plan. You should already know what exercises you will be performing that day before crossing the door. Have a routine instead of just improvising. Improvising lets your lizard brain to pick the exercises you are most comfortable doing. 

### Long-term consistency beats short-term intensity

[Firas Zahabi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firas_Zahabi) makes an interesting point about the relationship between consistency and intensity. 
Imagine that 10 pull-ups is the max amount of pull-ups you can do in a row while keeping a good form. Firas thinks that **you should never train to your max**. 
Why? Because if you do, your body will not have the right level of energy to endure a good work out tomorrow.


What should you do instead? If 10 is your max then do 5. But do 5 every day. His point is that by the end of the year you will have done much more pull-ups than someone
who gives its 100% but needs more trainning sessions to recover. He also argues that if someone doesn't need a day to recover 
from their max effort then they haven't trainned to their full potential.

The idea is that if you keep trainning every day those 5 pull-ups will soon become 6 and then 7. 

{% include video id="_fbCcWyYthQ" provider="youtube" %}


### Don't count your reps but make your reps count

We love the things we can measure. People may ask you *How much can you bench?* but they will never ask *How good is your form?*.

Our brain while in autopilot mode is willing to sacrificy good form for either extra repetitions or extra weight on any given workout.
It's your duty to remain vigilant of this possible behavior. Always prioritize good form and tension in your muscles rather. 
Focus on exercising to your full range of motion. I know, this is hard specially because if you start trainning correctly all the
metrics you were using to track your progress are going down for sure. Good, those numbers don't matter if they are not aligned
with a philosopy that puts quality over quantity.


All the reps are equally valuable. Don't waste your time, make your best out of each opportunity you have for lifting. 

### Progressive overload

Now that we talked about putting enphasis on the quality of your reps, you do want to track your progress over time.

Your goal is to gradually increase the weight, frequency, or number of repetitions for your workouts.

As it's impossible to keep on your head all these numbers, you want to track them in your little notebook so you
have something to aim for. 


> If you can’t measure it you can’t improve it.
>
> -- <cite>Peter Drucker</cite>

If you don't track, the autopilot is going to take control and will convince you to stay in the zone you are most comfortable with.
The zone where you don't push yourself and you don't get to rip the results of trainning hard.

### Misc

- 50 minutes of good exercise is enough. You don't need to spend 2 hours at the gym every day.
- Gains come from the things that are hard for you.

- **TRACK.** Calory tracking is impossible to mantain over time but doing it for a while is REALLY worth it. You understand that most of your estimations about food are wrong. Calories in a spoon of mayo. Track everything, even that one spoon of olive oil.

### Ideas

- What do I eat and why? **Be a DOG.** Make your life simpler, remove choice overload for “what should I eat?” Have a system for making decisions, that way you don’t need to struggle with every single problem that comes into your way. Should I eat this or not? I never wonder Should I exercise or not. The answer is always yes unless I have something else to do. I never answer “no, because I don’t feel like it” but I can answer “I haven’t sleep well so I might take the time for resting and sleeping a bit extra in the morning”.
- **TRACK.** Calory tracking is impossible to mantain over time but doing it for a while is REALLY worth it. You understand that most of your estimations about food are wrong. Calories in a spoon of mayo. Track everything, even that one spoon of olive oil.
- Optimize for nutrition and not flavour. Take away and restaurants are never friends because they want to provide the tastiest food, regardless of how good is for your body.
- Eat food that only has one ingredient 🥦
- Make it easy for yourself, don’t buy chocolate. Plan ahead, avoid relying on your limited will power.
- No specific diet. Just common sense and good habits.slow but sustainable. I’m never on a diet cause I’m always on a diet. I don’t suffer. It gets easier over time.
- Our relationship with food. Why do we take pictures? Watch videos about it? Read so many restaurant reviews. Foodies → **RESEARCH**
    - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera_eats_first#:~:text=According to a study mentioned,is missing from the savoring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera_eats_first#:~:text=According%20to%20a%20study%20mentioned,is%20missing%20from%20the%20savoring). Food is a community event. sharing food photos also acts as a "social glue" to gather people together to participate in each other's eating experiences.[[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera_eats_first#cite_note-12)
    - “the increased anticipation built up from taking photos of the food made it taste better.”
    - The price? Intimacy is lost. One of the functions of [eating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating)
    —enabling families and friends to gather together and enhance intimacy—is lost.
    - Taking a photo of your food is a form of ritualistic behavior, too. **In a way it’s similar to praying before meals**
    - I guess the same effect would happen if we just waited for a minute contemplating the food before eating it.
- Food is engineered to be so tasty. Our brain seeks calories because it developed during thousands of years where they were hard to find. Now they are everywhere, all time accesible but our brain is still wired the old way.
- My story about being fat and growing in a family where food joined us but we never developed good eating habits. We don’t get together with friends to eat a salad.
- In my family we value quantity over quality. It’s very impossible to enjoy a fancy gourmet meal. We need a mountain of food overflowing our plate. When people ask “how was it?” we answer “I ate a lot”.

# Sustainability

- Don’t go into an all-or-nothing spartan diet. It’s impossible to sustain over a long period of time. Plan ahead. Don’t deprive from getting together with friends, but maybe have a salad with your burger instead of fries.
- Any diet that at a time different from NOW is doomed to failure. How little do you truly want something that you can delay its start to a later point in time? You don’t really want it that much.
