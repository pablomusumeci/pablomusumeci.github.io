This is the fourth in a [series of blog posts](https://pablomusumeci.github.io/categories/#software-interviews) 
where I describe my interviewing experience and thoughts in detail.

Once you've passed the coding interviews, there are still two more interviews to come.
I think that the coding interview is the hardest and the one that requires the most preparation but
you needed to be succesful at all of them if you want to get your dream job.

# System design interview

This interview is mostly about designing high level components (boxes and arrows) for solving a very general scenario.
The problem will be described with very few details and is up to you to go and capture the all the requirements.

Requirements are divided in two:
- **Functional requirements**: What should the system system do?
- **Non-functional requirements**: Attributes of the system such as scalability, availability, faul-tolerance, latency, data-integrity, security, etc.

The amount of things that can be discussed are pretty much endless, so your interviewer will guide you through the
areas they consider most important to be discussed. 

System design interviews can touch a bit of every topic but dive deep in only a handful.
Some people do more emphasis on the type of database used while some others care more about designing a clean API.

## Distributed systems 101

Here you have a short list of (very complex) topics you should read about:

- Understanding the CAP theorem and its importance
- Consistent hashing and its applications
- Consistency levels and their trade-offs
- Types of databases and when to use which
- Sharding and replication
- Publish-subscribe pattern
- [API versioning](https://stripe.com/blog/api-versioning)
- [Websockets and RPC](https://eng.uber.com/real-time-push-platform/)
- Consensus protocols (no need to go too deep here)

{% include video id="aXD4tWbkoJo" provider="youtube" %}

There is no good or bad solution, it all depends on the problem you are trying to solve and the trade-offs you are
willing to make. You might prefer availability over consistency when calculating the amount of likes on a social
media post. There it's not a big deal if you show incorrect (as in stale) data for a while as long as you show *something*.

Whereas in systems that handle money we are usually more worried about strong consistency (calculating the right value)
at the expense of some downtime.

## Avoid naming names

I highly encourage you to avoid naming specific technologies and just stay with the most generic abstraction as possible.
Instead of saying "I would cache things in Redis", just say that you would use an in-memory datastore. 
Use a NoSQL database in place of "I would use MongoDB". 

The moment you put a name out there your interviewers are going to start asking questions about that specific technology
and why you've made that specific choice.
Restrain yourself from mentioning technologies you are not to familiar with. For this kind of situations I always say 
something like:

> Disclaimer, I've never worked with this technology but I read that **${BUZZWORD}** is generally used to solve this kind of problem.
>
> -- <cite>Pablo</cite>

You should at least know the very basics of **${BUZZWORD}** technology and why people recommend it for solving this problem?
Don't just talk for the sake of talking. In general we prefer to work with someone who admits when they don't know something
instead of bullshiting their way out of a situation.

Not knowing is fine, dishonesty is not. This interview can bring up a wide variety of topics and no-one is expected to
be an expert in all of those. It's more about how would you tackle the *unknowns* and your thought process for that.
Identify single points of failure and bottlenecks. Be mindful about trade-offs and explicitly mention them to your interviewer.


## Practice is the best teacher

My way of learning about these topics is to first start by reviewing existing architectures and then go deep into theory as needed.
For instance, if you first understand the problem consistent-hashing is trying to solve, then the specifics will make much more sense to you.
Do not ready theory for the sake of reading theory. It won't hurt you but it will also not be the best usage of your time. You need tools
to solve problems. 

Which kind of problems? Here you have a not so short list I recommend for practicing:

- Design a rate limiter
- Design a URL shortener (like TinyUrl or Pastebin)
- Design a distributed ID generator (like [Twitter Snowflake](https://blog.twitter.com/engineering/en_us/a/2010/announcing-snowflake))
- Design a web crawler
- Design a notification system
- Design a ticketing system (like Ticketmaster or BookMyShow)
- Design a hotel booking system (like Booking or Airbnb)
- Design a news feed system in a social media platform
- Design a chat system

## Resources 
- [System Design Interview â€“ An insider's guide](https://www.amazon.com/System-Design-Interview-insiders-Second/dp/B08CMF2CQF) is a fantastic source of 
examples for preparing the SD interview. If you don't know how to start, please start with this book.

- An interviewer from *FAANG* recommended me the following course [Grokking the system design interview](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-system-design-interview). I personally haven't used it but heard amazing things about it.

I also wanted to share a few YouTube channels that I used:
   - [Hussein Nasser](https://www.youtube.com/user/GISIGeometry)
   - [Gaurav Sen](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRPMAqdtSgd0Ipeef7iFsKw)
   - [Code Karle](https://www.youtube.com/c/codeKarle)
   - [Tech Dummies Narendra L](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCn1XnDWhsLS5URXTi5wtFTA)
   - [SystemDesignInterview](https://www.youtube.com/c/SystemDesignInterview/)


Those channels are more about practical examples and interview preparation, but if you want more something theoretical check [Martin Kleppman's channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClB4KPy5LkJj1t3SgYVtMOQ), he is the author of the famous *Designing Data-Intensive Applications: The Big Ideas Behind Reliable, Scalable, and Maintainable Systems*.

# Behavioral interviews

I always disregarded the soft-skills interview as I consider myself a very talkative and easy-going person. The stereotypical programmer
is introverted, socially awkward and highly intellectual. I recognize parts of me that match the standard nerd although
I always considered myself *normal* enough to pass what I considered to be *the psycopath test*.

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
![standard nerds](/assets/images/acing-the-software-engineering-interview/standard-nerds.gif)
{: refdef}

At big companies though, this interview is much more than just a check to ensure that you are not a wacko.
Behavioral interviews are there to check if you are a match for the company's culture.
A company's culture is not constituted by their free lunch, friday drinks and games rooms. 
The culture of a company is its DNA.


## Compatibility check

I'm not going to go too deep into what embodies a company's culture but I will summarize it in a quote extracted from this [blog post](https://camillaboyer.medium.com/why-cultures-fail-3151e72d3ca8).

> Culture is how we do things here and how people act when nobody is watching.

Interviewers will throw at you **open-ended questions** about your past experiences to understand who you are. 
Why not asking directly? Because stories are a medium that more truthfuly reflect our core values compared to just describing our strenghts and weaknesses.
Stories teach. Let the story speak to the interviewer in its own way and skip the need to tell them what to think.
An example of a situation where you exhibited a particular trait is much more convincing than an empty statement about your persona.

All these questions start with something similar to  "Tell me about a time where..."

- You received tough feedback
- You had to provide tough feedback
- You built out a process
- You made a mistake
- You proposed an idea and was not agreed on
- You convinced someone to change their mind
- You mentored someone
- A project you were working on failed
- You didn't have enough resources but still had to deliver a project

How should we approach those types of questions?

## The hero's journey

This interview is all about telling a good story. We humans are fascinated by stories, 
that's the reason why we love watching movies and reading books.
It's absolutely critical that you pick good stories to illustrate your past experiences.

A good story is not one that depicts you as the perfect person or employee. Think about it, would you like
to see a movie where the main character is flawless? That would be pretty boring.

The heroes we love are fragile and flawed. They make mistakes and not always win. What we love about them is 
that each failure allows them to emerge stronger than before.

> We do not learn from experience, we learn from reflecting on experience.
>
> -- <cite>John Dewey</cite>

It's natural to try hiding your weaknesses during interviews but you shouldn't. Self-reflection
shows a person that wants to improve. You know you are not perfect, you know there are areas you should improve but you are a work in progress.

You should carefuly prepare and pick the stories you are going to be using during the interview. Think hard about all
your previous experiences because picking the right story to tell is not an easy task. You want to select a story
that makes you look good but not perfect.

Think about stories where you...

- Demostrated initiative instead of just complaining.
- Took risks but without being reckless.
- Made a mistake while trying to do something with good intentions.
- Led by example and inspired others.
- Decided something that seemed right at the moment but ended up being the wrong call.

You might come up with a few potential stories that can answer each question. Select the ones that 
best showcase the reasons why you should be hired.

:warning: Preparing the stories is definitely not *cheating* the interview. You will be advised before this interview
to prepare these examples. It's very challenging to come up with good examples on the spot. Use this opportunity to
reflect on your career and what you've learnt in each one of your jobs. 

## A good story needs only a good storyteller

Now that you have a few candidate stories, it's time to write a script. You want to narrate the situation providing
enough context but without going too deep into unnecesary details. 

Some people suggest using the [STAR](https://www.themuse.com/advice/star-interview-method) method.

- **S**ituation
- **T**ask
- **A**ction
- **R**esult

I rather use an old time classic like the [three act structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-act_structure).
Such construction is used in every single good story ever told. Setup, confrontation, and resolution.

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
![heroes journey](/assets/images/acing-the-software-engineering-interview/heroes-journey.png)
{: refdef}

Now is where the fun beings. Use a friend to practice your story-telling. Just explain them the situation in around five minutes.
Request them to ask questions if something is not clear. You need to get rid of the plot-holes.
Telling the same story over and over helps you master how that particular story should be told. 
Think about the best stories you share together with your friends or that story your grandpa always brings up at family reunions.
Keeping a good pace is key. You want to speak slow enough so that the story is easily absorbed but not so slowly that the listener mind checks out of the room.


## What is the cost of lies?

> Every lie we tell incurs a debt to the truth. Sooner or later, that debt is paid.
>
> -- <cite>Chernobyl, HBO</cite>

You might think that you don't have any good stories to tell, that nothing trully remarkable or extrordinary happened to you at work.
Perhaps you are considering inventing a story that shows you have all the ingredients the interviewer is looking after in a candidate.

I'm going to tell you why that's a terrible idea. By doing this you are showing your interviewers a big fat red flag.
Interviewers are pros. They had this interview hundreds of times before. They know how a good answer looks like and they can smell
a false story from miles away.

There will be two or tree nested questions about your stories. It will be impossible for you to maintain a credible lie.
They will caught you red-handed and that's the worst possible outcome of the interview. Dishonesty means 
instant disqualification.

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
![disqualified](/assets/images/acing-the-software-engineering-interview/disqualified.gif)
{: refdef}

Lying doesn't benefit you nor the company. You can only thrive in a work-place where you are a happy camper.
If you are not a mutual match then trying to force the relationship through lies will manifest later on and will be painful for all parties involved.


## The Miranda warning

If you are at this interviewing stage, you probably wrote your resume a few months ago and completely forgot about everything that's mentioned in there.
You might even had bent the truth a little bit to make your resume more attractive to recruiters. No one pays full attention to everything
that's written there anyway, right?

> Anything you say can be used against you in court.
>
> -- <cite>Miranda warning.</cite>

During this interview those things will come up. There is a possibility that you are requested to elaborate on 
any given sentence used in any part of your resume. For instance, if you mention __mentoring__ other engineers four years ago, then be prepared to provide
concrete examples about whom you mentored in the past and what was the outcome.

## Red flag detector ðŸš©

I believe that this type of interviews try to spot any big red flags before someone gets hired. It's impossible 
to say if hiring someone will be a success. It's much easier to judge if hiring this person is destined to fail at this particular company.
That doesn't mean the person is a failure, it just means that due to their personality they are not a a good fit for this one company.
People are different and so do companies. It's all about finding the perfect match.

# I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse

> Great news! - I received positive feedback from the team about your most recent interviews, and we'd like to make you an offer! 

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
![congratulations](/assets/images/acing-the-software-engineering-interview/congratulations.gif)
{: refdef}

That's it, you've made it. The long journey has come to an end. Yes but no. This is not over until a sheet of paper is signed (at least digitally).
Now we have to play a different kind of game.

You might think that negotiating is not your kind of thing. You rather take whatever the company offers to avoid having that awkard conversation about money.
You don't want to look like a greedy person, you just want a better job that pays more than your current. How much more? Whatever the company offers you.

> You do not get what you want. You get what you negotiate.
>
> -- <cite>Harvey Mackay.</cite>

What's the point on risking the job offer for an extra 5%? **WRONG**. You are most certainly not putting your offer on the line
and it's definitely not only 5%.

Negotiating a good offer can be an instant 20% raise and only takes you a few short meetings and some nerves of steel.
I'm not going to lie, is not going to be easy. Well, the situation is indeed not hard but your mind is will freak out about it. 
The fear of loosing everything will [cloud your judgement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framing_effect_(psychology)). We are risk-averse creatures.

## 

If you want to negotiate a better offer you need be honest with yourself about who has the better hand.
There are only two things that give you leverage:

### Acing the interviews

They love you. You 
### Have Competing offers.

There are some amazing resources written about this. Please go ahead an prepare yourself the same way you've prepared for all the other interviews.


These three links are a **must read**. They are also written in a fantastic way so it will both fun and educational.
