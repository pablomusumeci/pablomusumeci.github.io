A friend of mine, who is going through Google's interviewing process right now, shared me this brilliant [Github repo](https://github.com/checkcheckzz/system-design-interview) which Google recruiters recommend for the interview preparation. It is filled with plenty of useful material for any software engineering out there.

I haven't read all the material **yet**, I admit it, but I'm planning to do so. In the meantime, I wanted to share this great video about scalability (is one of the recommended lectures from the repo).

Just click here to watch the video!

The video is recorded lecture from [CS75 Harvard's course](http://cs75.tv/2012/summer/), delivered in such an amazing way by [David Malan](http://cs.harvard.edu/malan/bio/).

I know that the video is not short at all, but I strongly recommend you to find some time to watch it. Every minute of this lecture is worth it. David ability to teach complex things is remarkable, he really makes learning an easy job.

I know I'll try to keep watching his classes on my spare time. Finally, [here is the link for all his courses](http://cs.harvard.edu/malan/courses/).
