Little daily actions lead to huge results over time. The key is to **keep going even when it feels like nothing is happening**.

When you start working on a new habit, you might not see progress right away. 
At first, you're fueled by enthusiasm and motivation, but that will fade over time. 

When it does, it's tempting to quit, especially if you're not seeing the results you expected. 
You may find yourself in the **disappointment zone**, filled with self-doubt and questioning whether this is really for you.

But if you stick with it, you'll see significant results later on.
