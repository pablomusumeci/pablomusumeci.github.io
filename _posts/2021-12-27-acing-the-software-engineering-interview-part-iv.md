# Behavioral interview

Behavioral interviews check if you are a match for the company's culture. I'm not going to go deep
into what embodies a company's culture but I will summarize it in a quote extracted from this [blog post I really like](https://camillaboyer.medium.com/why-cultures-fail-3151e72d3ca8).

> Culture is how we do things here and how people act when nobody is watching.

Interviewers will throw at you **open-ended questions** about your past experiences to understand who are you. 
Why? Because stories are a medium that more truthfuly reflect our core values compared to just describing our strenghts and weaknesses.
Stories teach. Let the story speak to the interviewer in its own way and skip the need to tell them what to think.
An example of a situation where you exhibited a particular trait is much more convincing than an empty statement about your persona.

All these questions start with something similar to  "Tell me about a time where..."

- You received tough feedback
- You had to provide tough feedback
- You built out a process
- You made a mistake
- You proposed an idea and was not agreed on
- You convinced someone to change their mind
- Your project failed
- You didn't have enough resources but still had to deliver a project

How should we approach those types of questions?

## What makes a good story?
This interview is all about telling a good story. We humans are fascinated by stories, that's the reason why we love watching movies and reading books.
Interviewers want to know who are you and the window through which they are going to look at your experiences is the story you tell them.
It's absolutely critical that you pick good stories to illustrate your past experiences.

A good story is not one that depicts you as the perfect person or employee. Think about it, would you like
to see a movie where the main character is flawless? That would be pretty boring.

The heroes we love are fragile and flawed. They make mistakes and not always win. What we love about them is 
that each failure allows them to emerge stronger than before.

> A mistake is only a mistake when you don't learn from them. Otherwise it is a lesson.

It's natural to try hiding your weaknesses during interviews but you shouldn't. Self-reflection
shows a person that wants to improve. You know you are not perfect, you know there are areas you should improve but you are a work in progress.

You should carefuly prepare and pick the stories you are going to be using during the interview. Think hard about all
your previous experiences because picking the right story to tell is not an easy task. You want to select a story
that makes you look good but not perfect.

Think about stories where you...

- Demostrated initiative instead of just complaining.
- Took risks but without being reckless.
- Made a mistake while trying to do something with good intentions.
- Led by example and inspired others.

You might come up with a few potential stories that can answer each question. Select the ones that 
best showcase the reasons why you should be hired.

## Practice storytelling

Now that you have a few candidate stories, it's time to write a script. You want to narrate the situation providing
enough context but without going to deep into unnecesary details. 

Some people suggest using the [STAR](https://www.themuse.com/advice/star-interview-method) method.

- **S**ituation
- **T**ask
- **A**ction
- **R**esult

I rather use an old time classic like the [three act structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-act_structure).
Such construction is used in every single good story ever told. Setup, confrontation, and resolution.

Now is where the fun beings. Use a friend to practice your story-telling. Just explain them the situation in around five minutes.
Request them to ask questions if something is not clear. You need to get rid of the plot-holes.
Telling the same story over and over helps you master how that particular story should be told. 
Think about the best stories you share together with your friends or that story your grandpa always brings up at family reunions.
Keeping a good pace is key. You want to speak slow enough so that the story is easily absorbed but not so slowly that the listener mind checks out of the room.


## More than a nerd-meter

We programmers are a rare breed, I recognize that. We are nerds who most likely follow **${SCIENCE_FICTION_MOVIE_SAGA}**, love drinking coffee and sarcasm.
We were never part of the cool kids at school, always picked last in sports.

So I imagined that this interview was just for the company to do a sanity check on how the person they inteded to hire
ranks in the nerd-meter among all the nerds that currently work there. It's actually a bit more complex than that and I will throw some light on
what I learnt about this type of interviews.

## Culture is companies DNA



Do this person maintain the company's culture? If you hire too many people which mentality falls outside the spectrum 
of your companies' culture, then the culture will start to mutate as it is formed by its employees' values.
Can this person thrive in this company? Only if their values are aligned.

## Interpersonal skills

How well can you communicate your thoughts, ideas, perspectives and experiences to the person sitting in front of you? 
Do you play well with others? Do you share your toys?

## Red flag detector

I believe that this type of interviews try to spot any big red flag ðŸš© on the person about to be hired. It's impossible 
to say if hiring someone will be a success or not. It's much easier to judge this person is destined to fail in this company.
That doesn't mean the person is a failure, it means that due to their personality they are not a match for this particular company.
People are different and so do companies. It's all about finding the perfect match.


## Your experience
About you, teams you worked on, projects you completed, problems you faced.
The content of following video is pure gold and the YouTuber gets the message accross fantastically.
Really a must watch ðŸ‘‡

## Lying = instant-disqualification

Interviewers are pros. There will be one or two nested calls into the question. It's impossible to maintain a credible lie.

Be self-critical. Talk about your flaws. Show awareness, don't try to hide them.
