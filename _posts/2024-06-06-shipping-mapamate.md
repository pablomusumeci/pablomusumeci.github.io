We've all been there. You have an amazing idea, you know how to code. Hell yeah you know, you are a Senior Software Engineer.
You ship high quality code for a living. Your employer is gave you a strong performance review and pays you 
a generous salary for the valuable contributions you bring to the company. 

If you can do that for someone else, imagine what you can do for your own interest.
You know frameworks and languages, testing and deploying.  You are a swiss-army knife.


You have all the pieces of the puzzle. And if there is one missing, you rest assured that you can learn anything by yourself.
That's pretty much your job, right? Nothing can stop you from shipping your own personal project.


> To me ideas are worth nothing unless executed. They are just a multiplier. Execution is worth millions.

We all know how does the story end. **The project is never released**. But why? 
The usual escape-goat is lack of motivation. Flagelating yourself with the idea that you are just lazy.


I disagree, and Tyler Durden is going to help me explaining what's really going on.

# This is your life, and itâ€™s ending one minute at a time

I like the movie's version better though but let's break this quote down:

## Self-improvement is masturbation

[Urban Dictionary](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Mental%20Masturbation) (lol) defines mental masturbation as _"Intellectual activity that serves no practical purpose"_.

Feeling like youâ€™re achieving something when in reality youâ€™re not making any progress.
A distraction, a feel-good sensation used for entertainment that ultimately accomplishes nothing. Or at least nothing meaningful.

It's always the path of least resistance: Keeping yourself busy by working on _something_.
But, how many times do you stop to ask yourself if that something is the most impactful thing you could be working on. 


Professor of computer science and writer Cal Newport calls this **Busyness as Proxy for Productivity**.

> In the absence of clear indicators of what it means to be productive and valuable in their jobs, 
> many knowledge workers turn back toward an industrial indicator of productivity: 
> doing lots of stuff in a visible manner.
>
> -- <cite>Cal Newport</cite>

You get to feel good because you can tell to yourself that you are working instead of being slacking around. Sadly, the result is the same.

## Now self-destruction...

What prevents us from shipping is what we learned to became Senior Software Engineers. Which at some point becomes who we are.
We have deprogram ourselves from the role we are used to play. Inside product companies, there are usually product managers 
whose role is making sure we are building the right thing, so engineers can focus on building the thing right.

In your one-person operation, you get to wear all the hats. But your natural tendency is always going to be
leaning on your strongest side. 

For Tyler, pain is necessary to make real progress. Letting yourself go, your ego. 
If you want to succeed, you shouldn't be only an engineer aynmore. 

How do we let go our ego? We are engineers, we take pride on our craft. 
Scalability, reliability, extensibility. The buzzword list goes on and on.

Let your ego go and build. Start by building what for your high-engineering standards is... ðŸ’©r

Build something that makes you feel ashamed. More than the bare minimum and you are wasting your time.
Yes, the bare minimum is buggy, not mobile friendly, hardcoded and looks horrible.
Code something that if your coworkers knew, they would make fun of you. They are busy laughing while you are busy shipping. 
You laugh at the end.

# Remember Pieter Levels

[Pieter Levels](https://x.com/levelsio) story of [launching 12 startups in 12 months](https://levels.io/12-startups-12-months/) blew my mind.

{: refdef}

He ended up launching 8 in total that year. He first tested 5 project ideas he had, and once NomadList got traction, he focused on it.

Pieter is a self-taught developer. He uses the easiest, least glamorous tools like PHP and JQuery. 
He doesn't need to unlearn a craft and in that sense he has a tremendous advantage over us engineers.


Business and coding is about learning how to figure things out yourself"

My conclusion from listening to Pieter's story is: **Failing ain't failing. Failing is not shipping.**

## I got ninety-nine problems but coding ain't one

Wait a second, is this a free-pass to hack, hard-code and deploy untested code? No, this is reminder that
tech is a means to an end which always is solving a problem. What counts is what works.

There are a gazillion tasks you could be working on. How do you know what to focus on? What is the most impactful problem you could be solving right now?
At the beginning, the problem is always to find which problem is that one.

## What If You Already Know Enough?

Education system prepared me to study hard and pass my exams with an A.

The path for getting strong grades was clear, just study harder for longer. There was a deadline for the exam, and whether I liked it or not, 
I would face the test and verify if I knew my shit or not.

Life doesn't work like that when you are building something for yourself. There is no deadline so it's easy to keep
adding features and fixing defects until... until what?

I always think I don't know enough. I'm constantly looking for something else to consume before I can finally produce.
I can read another book, fix an extra bug, write another plan.

I was taught to consume information and read my way out of problems. Whenever a new problem came up, I could always search for a book or course that had the answer.
I'm shipping this blogpost to you because my time has arrived. My time to...

## SHIP, SHIP, SHIP! :ship:

Stop the [gold platting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_plating_(project_management)) and ship.
Stop adding features and ship. How else would you know if you are working on the right thing? SHIP.
The sooner you ship, the sooner you will find that out. Maybe that feature you deemed was critical, no one needs it.
Maybe that tiny and unimportant for you was your client's biggest pain point.

> -- <cite>Eric Ries</cite>


The world is so complex that I would say it's almost impossible to foresee the demand for a product until we test it in real life.
No one uses your feature or is will to pay for your product? [GOOD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdTMDpizis8), you learned something and can move on.
Ship, learn and pivot. Pivoting happens when we change our old hypothesis of "market needs this" and create a new one that we can test.

## Do you practice what you preach?

I do. Say hello to my first project: [MapaMate](https://pablomusumeci.com/mapamate/). I'm a fanatic [mate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mate_(drink)) drinker
and always struggled with running out of yerba while traveling. 

Sure, you can buy yerba online, but waiting for delivery is a luxury you can't afford on the go.
So, I created a [Google Sheet where anyone can add and edit store locations that sell yerba](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bOF7Mb7Myfc83hDD2zRVAFnWzedSXzddFlqGxjDfApQ/edit#gid=0).

I felt like a lot of people face this problem, so I shared this MVP on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/yerbamate/comments/1d86xou/mapamate_map_of_yerba_stores_around_the_world/).
The result? Absolutely no-one cared and that made me feel... good. Why? Because I shipped a horrible website 
built with the fastest and worst Javascript I was able to produce to validate if someone was interested.

I quickly validated that investing more time on this was an absolute waste and moved on for the time being.
