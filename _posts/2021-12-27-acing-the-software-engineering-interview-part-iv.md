## More than a nerd-meter

We programmers are a rare breed, I recognize that. We are nerds who most likely follow **${SCIENCE_FICTION_MOVIE_SAGA}**, love drinking coffee and sarcasm.
We were never part of the cool kids at school, always picked last in sports.

So I imagined that this interview was just for the company to do a sanity check on how the person they inteded to hire
ranks in the nerd-meter among all the nerds that currently work there. It's actually a bit more complex than that and I will throw some light on
what I learnt about this type of interviews.

## Culture is companies DNA

Behavioral interviews check if we are a match for the company's culture. I'm not going to go deep
into what embodies a company's culture but I summarize it in a quote extracted from this [blog post I really like](https://camillaboyer.medium.com/why-cultures-fail-3151e72d3ca8).

> Culture is how we do things here and how people act when nobody is watching.

Do this person maintain the company's culture? If you hire too many people which mentality falls outside the spectrum 
of your companies' culture, then the culture will start to mutate as it is formed by its employees' values.
Can this person thrive in this company? Only if their values are aligned.

## Interpersonal skills

How well can you communicate your thoughts, ideas, perspectives and experiences to the person sitting in front of you? 
Do you play well with others? Do you share your toys?

## Red flag detector

I believe that this type of interviews try to spot any big red flag ðŸš© on the person about to be hired. It's impossible 
to say if hiring someone will be a success or not. It's much easier to judge this person is destined to fail in this company.
That doesn't mean the person is a failure, it means that due to their personality they are not a match for this particular company.
People are different and so do companies. It's all about finding the perfect match.


## Your experience

## Example questions

Here you have some example situations that interviewers can throw at you to understand who you are.
They are all open-ended and start with  "Tell me about a time where..."

- Received tough feedback
- Gave tough feedback
- You built out a process
- You made a mistake
- You proposed an idea and was not agreed on
- You convinced someone to change their mind
- Your project failed
- You didn't have enough resources but still had to deliver a project anyway.
