Originally from Argentina but currently living in Amsterdam. 
I've graduated from the [University of Buenos Aires](http://fi.uba.ar) with a Software/Computer Engineering degree and have
been working as a Java Backend Engineer at [Picnic  Supermarkt](https://picnic.app/nl/) (fastest growing company in The Netherlands) for the last 4 years.

I approach work with a mindset of "I will do whatever it takes to get the job done". That kind of mentality pushed me to 
learn a bit of everything as I don't really care that much about the technology as I
care about the problem that lies in front of me. Can be databases, infrastructure, even frontend!

I enjoy reading, playing football, hiking with my dog and travelling and meeting new people!
