What comes next is for the ones who are interested in the process so you can apply this to any artwork of your choice.

# Reverse Midjourneying

Midjourney, the revolutionary AI image generator, has just unveiled its newest wonder – the `/describe` command. 
With this command, users can now transform their images into textual descriptions of the key aspects of the image!


For instance, you could use the `/describe` command to unlock the mysteries behind the iconic GTA art. 
Are you curious about the elements that make it so distinguishable and unique?

Once you've uncovered the secrets of a piece of art, you can easily customize it to your liking. 
With a few tweaks, you can transform any image into something truly unique and personalized!


### /describe

I started by finding a good reference image from GTA and feed it into Midjourney.

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
![GPT](/assets/images/midjourney/gta/gta_original.jpg)
{: refdef}

Then, I feed that into Midjourney

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
![GPT](/assets/images/midjourney/gta/prompt.jpg)
{: refdef}

The generated descriptions are::

1. a man in a suit holding up a gun over a city background,, in the style of photorealist painter, 8k, celebrity portraits --ar 8:5

2. gta 5 a suit and gunman in the city, in the style of realistic landscape paintings, frank thorne, vik muniz, panorama, oliver wetter, hand-coloring, smokey background --ar 8:5

3. the grand theft avatar is standing holding the gun, in the style of photorealistic cityscapes, richly colored skies, wimmelbilder, cobra, bold saturation innovator, subtle expressions, ultra hd --ar 8:5

4. grand theft video games on iphone android tablet desktop, in the style of celebrity image mashups, life-size figures, dazzling cityscapes, celebrity-portraits, figura serpentinata, handsome, stockphoto --ar 8:5

I found option number two to be the most appealing, so I did a quick search on some of the artists mentioned in the description, such as Frank Thorne, Vik Muniz, and Oliver Wetter. 
I was pleased by their artwork and decided to give it a shot. Admittedly, my selection process was not exactly scientific.

Note that `–ar 8:5` is the aspect ratio that was taken from the original iamge.

### /imagine

To give it a more personalized look, I used Lio Messi as the main character of my image. 

Like many Argentinians, I'm obssesed with our most beloved sports icon of all time but there was a problem.
Unfortunately, Midjourney had difficulty capturing all the details of Messi's face, resulting in images that didn't quite look right to me.

I've decided to go for a more cartoonish version of him instead. It's a fun and creative way to work around the limitations of the technology, and it should hide any flaws that would make the photorealistic images look kind of creepy.

This is known as the 'uncanny valley' effect. Like when you see a robot that looks almost human but not quite, 
and it gives you the creeps - like it's a bad CGI character that wandered off the set of a low-budget movie. See:

> 4k, hyper realistic, real life, real, more real, real model, same clothing, barcelona, total body, full body, model, messi face, leonel messi, clothing, messi face, messi pic, details, hyper detailed, same as pic, beautiful, future, messi

Let's get back to bussiness.

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}

While any of the descriptions could have worked, I decided to focus on number two, as it seemed to strike the best balance between the GTA theme and Messi as the main character.

I decided to get more variations of number two. Hopefully with some luck I would get a face that looks more like Messi.

Sweet, this is much better. Let's upscale image number one.

We just stamp a GTA V logo on top of it and call it for the day. 

I hope you enjoyed this quick tutorial and I'm eager to see your creations!
