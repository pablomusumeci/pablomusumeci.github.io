You, me, weâ€™ve all been there. You have an amazing idea. You see the problem and canâ€™t stop thinking about the solution. 
You know how to codeâ€”hell yeah you do. Youâ€™re a Senior Software Engineer. 
You ship high-quality code for a living, and maybe you even have a CS degree.


Your employer gave you a _exceeds expectations_ score on your performance review.
They pay you a generous salary plus equity for all the valuable contributions you bring to the company. 


You wonder: If I can do that for someone else, imagine the things I can do for myself.
You know frameworks and languages, testing and deploying.  You are the swiss-army knife of software.


There is no bureaucracy around you to slow you down. No daily stand-ups, no JIRA tickets, no coffee chats, 
no endless meetings, no redundant code reviews, no micromanagement, no waiting for approvals, and no unnecessary documentation.


You have all the pieces of the puzzle. And if there is one missing, you rest assured that you can learn anything by yourself.
That's pretty much your job, right? Nothing can stop you from shipping your idea.
You can already feel the high of real people using your product to solve their problems.


> To me ideas are worth nothing unless executed. They are just a multiplier. Execution is worth millions.
>
> -- <cite>Steve Jobs</cite>

I know how the story ends. **The project is never released**. 
Am I a magician? Do I have hidden cameras at your home spying on you?
No, I'm just like you.


Have you ever asked yourself why does the story always end the same? The usual escapegoat is lack of motivation. 
You flagellate yourself with the idea that youâ€™re just lazy. If only you had the discipline to push through, everything would be different.

I disagree, and Tyler Durden is going to help me explaining you what's really going on.

I like the movie's version better though. Let's break this quote down:

## Self-improvement is masturbation

[Urban Dictionary](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Mental%20Masturbation) defines mental masturbation as _"Intellectual activity that serves no practical purpose"_.

It's the illusion of progress without real advancement, a feel-good distraction that accomplishes nothing meaningful.

Itâ€™s the path of least resistance: staying busy with _something_. But how often do you ask if that something is the most impactful thing you could be doing?

Cal Newport, a computer science professor and author, calls this **Busyness as Proxy for Productivity**:

> In the absence of clear indicators of what it means to be productive and valuable in their jobs, 
> many knowledge workers turn back toward an industrial indicator of productivity: 
> doing lots of stuff in a visible manner.
>
> -- <cite>Cal Newport</cite>

You feel good because youâ€™re working on it, not just slacking around like lazy people do. Sadly, the result is the same as doing nothing.

## Now self-destruction...

What prevents us from shipping is what made us Senior Software Engineers. 
At some point, this becomes our identity. We must deprogram ourselves from this role. 
In product companies, product managers ensure we build the right thing, so engineers can focus on building the thing right.

In your solo venture, you wear all the hats. But your natural tendency will be to lean on your strongest skills.

For Tyler, pain is necessary for real progress. Letting go of your ego is crucial. If you want to succeed, you must become more than just an engineer.

How do we let go of our ego? We take pride in our craft â€” scalability, reliability, extensibility. The buzzword list goes on.

Let go of your ego and build. Start by creating something that, by your high standards, is... ðŸ’©

Build something that makes you feel ashamed. More than the bare minimum, and youâ€™re wasting your time. 
Yes, the bare minimum is buggy, not mobile-friendly, hardcoded, and looks horrible. 
Code something that would make your coworkers laugh at you. 
Theyâ€™re busy laughing while youâ€™re busy shipping. Youâ€™ll laugh in the end.

# Remember Pieter Levels

[Pieter Levels](https://x.com/levelsio) blew my mind with his story of [launching 12 startups in 12 months](https://levels.io/12-startups-12-months/).

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}

{: refdef}

He ended up launching 8 startups that year. He first tested 5 project ideas he had, and once NomadList gained traction, he focused on it.

Pieter is a self-taught developer who uses the easiest, least glamorous tools like PHP and jQuery. 
He doesn't need to unlearn a craft, which gives him a tremendous advantage over us engineers.


> To build your idea, learn to code. Just Google: "How to make a website?"
> Business and coding is about learning how to figure things out yourself.
>
> -- <cite>Pieter Levels</cite>

My conclusion from listening to Pieter's story is: **Failing ain't failing. Failing is not shipping.**

## I got ninety-nine problems but coding ain't one

Wait a second, is this a free pass to hack, hard-code, and deploy untested code? 
No, this is a reminder that tech is a means to an end, which is always solving a problem. 
What counts is what works.


There are a gazillion tasks you could be working on. How do you know what to focus on? What is the most impactful problem you could be solving right now? 
At the beginning, the problem is always figuring out which problem that is.

## What If You Already Know Enough?

The education system prepared me to study hard and pass my exams with an A.
The path to strong grades was clear: study harder and longer. There was a deadline for the exam, and whether I liked it or not, I would face the test and verify if I knew my shit or not.

Life doesnâ€™t work like that when youâ€™re building something for yourself. Thereâ€™s no deadline, so itâ€™s easy to keep adding features and fixing defects until... until what? 

How do I know if I already know enough? Pieter Levels learnt what he needed to solve the problem in front of him.
He didn't started a journey to _learn how to code_. There is no finish line for that. 
He wanted to add a feature to his project and learn just enough to solve that and move on.


## Are you a consumer or a producer?

You have this urge to create something, that's why you started a project in the first place.
Maybe you haven't started it, but you fidget with the idea constantly.
You are playing the wrong team, the _consumer team_.

Iâ€™m constantly looking for something else to consume before I can finally produce. 
There is always another book I can read, another tutorial I can watch.
I was taught to consume information as the way out of problems.
That's how it works in school and university.
Whenever a new problem came up, I could always search for the answer. 


But now, my time has come to act. To drop the script I've been following my entire life. 
My time to switch teams and become a producer.

# Building the right thing instead of building the thing right

The Lean Startup methodology centers on validating ideas quickly and efficiently. 
The goal is to avoid wasting time and resources on features and products that don't solve real problems for customers.

> Successful startups are those that manage to iterate enough times before running out of resources.
>
> -- <cite>Eric Ries</cite>

Practical Steps to Build the Right Thing

1. Define Your Hypotheses: Clearly state what you believe to be true about your product and market.
2. Create the MVP: Build the simplest version of your product that can test your hypotheses.
3. Collect Feedback: Release the MVP to a small group of users and gather their feedback.
4. Analyze Results: Determine if your hypotheses are validated or if you need to pivot.
5. Iterate: Use the insights gained to improve your product in small, manageable steps.

## Focus on Validated Learning

> Validated learning is the process of demonstrating empirically that a team has discovered 
> valuable truths about a startupâ€™s present and future business prospects.
>
> -- <cite>Eric Ries</cite>


It's about testing your hypotheses with real-world data. 
Instead of building a polished product from the start, you build just enough to test your ideas. 
This approach minimizes waste and ensures youâ€™re solving the right problems.

## Embracing the Pivot
A pivot is a fundamental change in your product or business model based on the feedback you receive. 
Itâ€™s not a sign of failure but a strategy for finding a viable product-market fit. 

You test a hypothesis and realize you are were either right or wrong. Both ways you win.
You should pivot as soon as you realize your current path isn't leading to success.

Expect to pivot many times. That is not quitting or failing.
It is adjusting, tuning, and improving.

**Pivoting ain't failing. Failing is not shipping.**

# Conclusions

## Do you practice what you preach?

I do. Say hello to my first project: [MapaMate](https://pablomusumeci.com/mapamate/). I'm a fanatic [mate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mate_(drink)) drinker
and always struggled with running out of yerba while traveling. 

Sure, you can buy yerba online, but waiting for delivery is a luxury you can't afford on the go.
So, I created a [Google Sheet where anyone can add and edit store locations that sell yerba](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bOF7Mb7Myfc83hDD2zRVAFnWzedSXzddFlqGxjDfApQ/edit#gid=0).

I felt like a lot of people face this problem, so I shared the MVP on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/yerbamate/comments/1d86xou/mapamate_map_of_yerba_stores_around_the_world/).
I also had a hypothesis on people willing to contribute places they know instead of me having to source all of them.

The result? Absolutely no-one cared and that made me feel... good. Why? Because I shipped a horrible website 
built with the fastest and worst Javascript I was able to produce to validate if someone was interested.

I quickly validated my hypothesis and realized that investing more time on this would be an absolute waste.
I know now something I didn't know until I shipped. It's time to pivot.

## Hungry for more?

This post is based on my personal struggles shipping a personal project combined with some amazing books I've read such as:

- Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World by Cal Newport
- The Lean Startup: How Constant Innovation Creates Radically Successful Businesses by Eric Ries
- The Millionarie Fastlane by MJ DeMarco.

They punishes mistakes and view them in a bad way.

In business it's the opposite. You learn from taking action not from learning from a course or book. You learn door to door sales from action. You learn Google ads from helping someone. You learn something by taking action, not by learning a course. You learn from others and your mistakes. It's best to learn something when actually DOING it.

In business, you fail, you learn from your mistakes, you try again and apply the mistakes you've learnt. And mistakes are expected and natural to come by, just have to learn from it.
