After some months of inactivity I bring you this great video about the most important question in the history of computer science.

The best thing about this video is that if you have no idea of what P vs NP is or why it is so important, 
you can clear those doubts with this short but complete introduction to the subject in only 10 entertained minutes. 

Just click here to watch the video!
