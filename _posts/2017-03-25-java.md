Things I learned reading [Java Programming Interviews Exposed](https://www.amazon.com/Java-Programming-Interviews-Exposed-Markham/dp/1118722868).
This is not intended to be a detailed summary about the book, it is more like a self-reminder of the things I didn't know and found interesting.

Collections:

* ArrayList doesn't automatically shrink while removing elements (can be done invoking [trimToSize()](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1ator.5.0/docs/api/java/util/ArrayList.html#trimToSize()))

* HashMap vs Hashtable: Hashtable is thread-safe (at the expense of being slower because of all of its methods being synchronized) while HashMap it's not. If you need a thread-safe implementation of HashMap, it is preferred to use ConcurrentHashMap instead (performance improvements for reads because it doesn't use one single lock).

* Volatile vs Atomic: *volatile* means that each individual read and write operation on that variable is atomic. Keep in mind that an operation that requires more than one read/write (for instance *i++*) is not atomic because other thread can modify *i* in between. Atomic classes provide a set of [truly atomic operations](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/atomic/AtomicInteger.html).

* Map's keyset is only a view of the map. Changes on the map are reflected on the keyset and viceversa.

Fail-fast vs fail-safe:

* Fail-Fast iterators immediately throw an exception if a collection is modified while iterating over it.

* Fail-Safe iterators donâ€™t throw any exceptions if a collection is modified while iterating over it. This happens because they operate over a clone of the collection.

 All the collection classes in java.util package are fail-fast, while the collection classes in java.util.concurrent are fail-safe.

* Arrays can contain primitive or objects, while an ArrayList can contain only objects.

Classloading:

* Whenever we compile any Java file, the compiler will embed a public, static, final field named class, of the type java.lang.Class

* A class is uniquely identified in a JVM using its fully qualified class name along with the instance of the ClassLoader that loaded the class

Classloaders:

* Bootstrap classloader: Responsible for loading key Java classes like java.lang.Object and other runtime code into memory first. We cannot find the details of the bootstrap class loader in the Java documentation, since this is a native implementation.

* Extension classloader: Responsible for loading all .jar files kept in the java.ext.dirs path

* Application classloader: Responsible for loading all of the classes kept in the path corresponding to the java.class.path system property
