I live in Amsterdam, one of the cities with the highest quality of life in the world.
It is also a place where most likely than not the weather is cloudy and rainy. 


Everybody's favorite hobby is complaining about that unavoidable fact. Everybody but me, I recently decided to quit.
I now accept the everpresent greyness of the sky as a toll we must pay to enjoy life here.


I'm conducting a personal crusade against the mere act of complaining. We all do it much more often than we think.
It happens so automatically that we barely register it. We do it about all kinds of things, big and small. 
Some we can do nothing about like the weather, whereas there are others we could but find complaining a much easier path than taking action.


One could say that it's a coping mechanism against the dire nature of life.
A way of blowing up steam, a relief valve. 
Believing that without this venting we would continually accumulate all those negative thoughts until we experience a mental breakdown.


If that were true, the people who complain all the time would be happiest. They would have allowed all their negative feelings to escape their brains and fly away.
The bitterness displayed by serial complainers quickly disproves this belief of complaining as a mechanism for purging pessimistic opinions from our minds.
I'm sure you can think of more than one person who fits this description.


Who would you rather spend your time with? A chronic complainer who can only see the dark side of everything
or a person who lifts the spirit of the room with their contagious energy every time they come in. 
Think about these two stereotypes and pay special attention to how you feel around them. 
You can now choose the type of person you want to be.


# Why do we complain?


> Don't be overheard complaining... not even to yourself.

Complaining provides us with a minousclous hit of instantaneous gratification. There must be something happening on our brains
that drives us to complain as much as we do. If not, we wouldn't do it. There are always reasons why we behave the way we do,
even if we can't fully understand them.
Complaining doesn't come for free. 
We use our long-term happiness to pay for this small but frequent gratification derived from complaining.


Some might argue that it's our human nature. 
Evolution equipped us with a [negativity bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negativity_bias) that maximizes our chances of survival.
Remaining ignorant of all possible adverse outcomes doesn't contribute to preparing for when life goes wrong.
Awareness translated into a longer life, even if that meant an unhappier one. Evolution does not care about our feelings.


# What can we do?

We quickly embrace that complaining is unavoidable. We have no control over the thoughts that spontaneously materialize in our heads
That doesn't mean that we are not responsible for keeping them to ourselves instead of sharing them with the world.


> Between stimulus and response there is a space. In that space is our power to choose our response. In our response lies our growth and our freedom.

> -- <cite>Victor Frankl</cite>


Negative thoughts will keep arising automatically. It's part our nature and we shouldn't punish ourselves on that.
We need to embrace that have the power to choose what we do about them. We can reject the efortless impulse
and work towards subduing our impulses and instincts.

# A seller cannot exist without a buyer


I once heard that our mind produces thoughts and the mouth buys them every time we say them outloud.

We are social creatures. Our complains affect not only ourselves but the people that sourrounds us.
We absorb this negativity from our own mouth and from the ones we contributed to poison with negativity.


If we can stop ourselves from expressing these complains, we will be contributing to their scarcity.
If we encounter them less often, our brain will dimish the rate at which it produces them. **Out of sight out of mind.**


Remember the first of the 4 agreements stated in [Miguel Ruiz' book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6596.The_Four_Agreements). 

**Be impeccable with your word**. Use the power of your word in the direction of truth and love. Your words have the power to both create and destroy.
If what is going to come out of your mouth is not adding anything positive to the world,  it's better to keep it to yourself.

# Be grateful

We clearly remember all the situations that go wrong but easily forget the positive outcomes. Moreover, we don't pay
any attention to the things that could have gone wrong but didn't.


What happens if we almost get hit by a car? We experience an immediate sense of relief that washes away very quickly. 
5 minutes after the event we feel as if that never happened as there are no consequences at all.
If we are not so lucky to avoid the situation and actually get into an accident, then we rant about our bad luck and how all the bad things always happen to us.


The antidote for complaining is gratitude. Do a concious effort of contemplating all the good things we should be grateful about.
Practicing gratitude is not about forcing yourself to feel positive. Itâ€™s about noticing that there are also good things going on in your life.
