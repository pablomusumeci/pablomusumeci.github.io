The Boots Theory suggests that spending more on quality items can save money in the long run. 
Investing in durable, well-made products may cost more upfront, but they'll last longer and provide better value over time. 
This idea is important because it helps us **prioritize long-term benefits over short-term gains**.

#### Wealth Inequality Perpetuates Itself
The Boots Theory also highlights how wealth inequality can perpetuate itself. 
Rich people can afford better food, exercise, and education, which can lead to better health and higher income opportunities. 


In contrast, poor people may struggle to afford these essential investments, which can keep them trapped in poverty.

One way to break this cycle is through lending. 
By providing loans or credit, people can access resources they otherwise couldn't afford. 
For example, student loans allow individuals to invest in their education, which can lead to higher-paying jobs.

### Example

> Take boots, for example. He earned $38 a month plus allowances. A really good pair of leather boots cost $50. 
> But an affordable pair of boots, which were sort of OK for a season or two and then leaked like hell when the cardboard gave out, cost about $10. 
> 
> The thing was that good boots lasted for years and years. A man who could afford $50 had a pair of boots that'd still be keeping his feet dry in ten years' time, 
> while the poor man who could only afford cheap boots would have spent a $100 on boots in the same time and would still have wet feet.
